About
--------------------------------

Manifest is a clean and streamlined theme that focuses on the content and not the distractions. It utilizes a single column, 500 pixel wide layout. No sidebars. No widgets.

Feel free to use as you please, I just ask that you keep the Manifest link at the bottom. Thanks and enjoy.


Basic Setup
---------------------------------

- Archives Page
Setup your Archives page by creating a new page in the Wordpress admin and selecting the Archives template.


- Links Page
Setup your Links page by creating a new page in the Wordpress admin and selecting the Links template.


- Footer Links
The footer links are controlled via the "Links" feature in Wordpress. To assign a link to the footer, create a link category called "footer" and assign the links to that category.

- Wordpress Photo Gallery
To achieve the look of the Manifest Wordpress photo gallery, update you media thumbnail site to 150x150 and the "Max Width" and "Max Height" of the medium size to 500.
